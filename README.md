## Tic tac toe DeathMatch

Two days of code. You can test the result [here](http://luka.isms.si/tictactoe).

E-mail me at lukam@nym.hush.com if you're able to win, or if you're able to break it - no cheating though. If you click on a square while the computer is making the move, you'll override it.

The code is a mess I know - but hey, it's game code.
